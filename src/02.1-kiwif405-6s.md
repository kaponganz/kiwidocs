# Flight Controller Board: KIWI F405 6S Configuration

## Description

The KIWI F4.0 is a versatile STM32F405-based flight controller designed for FPV, fixed-wing aircraft, and autonomous
platforms. It integrates precise inertial sensing, OSD support, built-in Blackbox logging, and relay outputs for
controlling external modules. With support for both Betaflight and ArduPilot, the board can be deployed across a wide
range of use cases.

KIWI F4.0 is a reliable platform for building FPV drones, aircraft, and specialized autonomous systems. Its flexible
support for relays, sensors, and telemetry makes it ready for real-world mission environments.
