## Description

KIWI F4.0 is a versatile flight controller based on the STM32F405, designed for FPV, wings, and autonomous platforms.  
The controller combines precision inertial sensing, OSD support, built-in Blackbox, and relay outputs for controlling
external modules.  
Support for both Betaflight and ArduPilot allows this board to be used in a wide range of applications.

KIWI F4.0 is a reliable platform for building FPV drones, aircraft, and specialized autonomous systems with full support
for Betaflight and ArduPilot.  
Thanks to flexible relay, sensor, and telemetry connectivity, the controller is ready for real-world mission use.
